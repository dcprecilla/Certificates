# Certificates
I do believe that the best way to showcase earned skills is through projects but I would like to acknowledge the courses that got me those skills. I have completed various courses from DataCamp, Coursera, Udemy, and Salesforce Trailhead. Training is essential in upskilling, some of these platforms have their own IDEs and I could not capture the exercises, assessments and quizzes that I passed. I have tried my best to document my progress but another way of showing this progress is through the certificates:

## DataCamp:
