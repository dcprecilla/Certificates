# Certificates
I do believe that the best way to showcase earned skills is through projects but I would like to acknowledge the courses that got me those skills. I have completed various courses from DataCamp and Coursera. Training is essential in upskilling, some of these platforms have their own IDEs and I could not capture the exercises, assessments and quizzes that I passed. I have tried my best to document my progress but another way of showing this progress is through the certificates:

## DataCamp:
  ### SQL Fundamentals Track: [link to track certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/bf592fc703fae47f06986e7d24c4344f57a3d66e)
